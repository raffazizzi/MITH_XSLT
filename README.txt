XSLT transformations and related materials for MITH
2013

Currently transforming TEI XSLT representing page transcriptions
(surfaces, zones and lines) into structural TEI (chapters and paragraphs).
As such, these stylesheets aim to provide a pathway from page transcription
to reading and study texts.

Includes Schematron for validating source documents.

This is very much ad-hoc, and will work only on the sample data set indicated.

On the other hand, it should be:

* fairly robust
* a basis for refinement (in other words, this code can improve as we get better ideas)
